### How to clone
This project has the [Unity repository](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) as a submodule. If you only clone the exterior repository, you will not be able to compile the unity test runner. Clone with:

	`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WarrenTheRabbit/TDD-with-Unity.git`
